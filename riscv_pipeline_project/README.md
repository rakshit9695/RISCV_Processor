## üîß Overview

This CPU demonstrates the power of **instruction pipelining**, splitting instruction execution into the following stages:

1. **Instruction Fetch (IF)**
2. **Instruction Decode (ID)**
3. **Execute (EXE)**
4. **Write Back (WB)**

Each stage operates in parallel, enabling **instruction-level parallelism** and higher throughput compared to single-cycle CPUs.

## üîÑ Pipeline Flow: Step by Step

### 1. **Instruction Fetch (IF)**
- `PC` generates instruction address.
- `memory` fetches instruction from that address.
- `IF_IDstage` stores PC and instruction for the next cycle.

### 2. **Instruction Decode (ID)**
- Decode instruction via `control`.
- `regfile` reads source registers.
- Immediate values are extracted.
- Output passed to `ID_EXEstage`.

### 3. **Execute (EXE)**
- `alu` performs operation (ADD, SUB, AND, etc.).
- Branch decision logic runs (if needed).
- Result stored in `EXE_WBstage`.

### 4. **Write Back (WB)**
- If `regwrite` is active, result is written back to `regfile`.

## üí° Critical Digital Concepts

- **Combinational vs. Sequential Logic**: ALU/control = combinational; pipeline registers = sequential.
- **Clocking**: Pipeline separated by flip-flops clocked every cycle.
- **Async Reads / Sync Writes**: Register file supports asynchronous reads and synchronous writes.
- **Pipeline Buffers**: Enable concurrent instruction execution in different stages.
- **Control Signals**: Drive the pipeline's decisions and routing logic.

## üß† Computer Architecture Principles

- **Pipelining**: Improves performance by processing multiple instructions in parallel.
- **Instruction-Level Parallelism**: Enabled by stage separation.
- **Hazards (Simplified)**: This design lacks forwarding/stalling, so instruction scheduling is important.
- **RISC Simplicity**: Easy-to-decode instructions, fixed-length encoding.
- **Memory Initialization**: Simple ROM setup with a `.hex` program file.

## üß™ Simulation Instructions

1. Set up the folder structure as shown above.
2. Add Verilog source code to each `.v` file.
3. Write a test program into `program.hex` using machine code format.
4. Run `tb_core.v` in a simulator like:
   - [Icarus Verilog](http://iverilog.icarus.com/)
   - [EDA Playground](https://www.edaplayground.com/)
5. Observe waveforms or console logs to verify pipeline behavior.

### Sample `program.hex`:
```text
000005b7  // lui x11,0x0
00500113  // addi x2,x0,5
00700193  // addi x3,x0,7
003101b3  // add  x3,x2,x3
00318663  // beq  x3,x3,-4
